# Project Rules & Guidelinesnn## 1. Project Structure & Organizationn- Each component should be in its own folder named after the component, following the existing structure.n- Keep the overall project structure consistent as it grows (e.g., `components/`, `pages/`, `services/`, `store/`, `styles/`).nn## 2. Naming Conventionsn- Use PascalCase for React component and folder names (e.g., `CarCard`, `SearchForm`).n- Use camelCase for variables and functions.n- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants.nn## 3. File Organizationn- Each component folder should contain at least the main component file (e.g., `CarCard.tsx`) and optionally related files (styles, tests).n- Keep styles for a component in the same folder or in a central `styles/` directory, but be consistent.nn## 4. Code Stylen- Use consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces, depending on your team preference).n- Prefer single quotes for strings (or double quotes, but be consistent).n- Use semicolons at the end of statements.n- Use ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, etc.).nn## 5. TypeScript Usagen- Type all props and state explicitly.n- Prefer interfaces for props and state definitions.n- Avoid using `any` unless absolutely necessary.nn## 6. Component Designn- Prefer functional components and React hooks.n- Keep components small and focused; split if they grow too large.n- Use prop-types or TypeScript interfaces for prop validation.nn## 7. State Managementn- Use Redux Toolkit for global state (as in your `store/`).n- Use local state for UI-specific or ephemeral state.nn## 8. Styling & Themingn- All colors must be defined in a single global SCSS file (e.g., `styles/colors.scss`).n- All component and page styles must be written in SCSS files; avoid inline styles in JSX.n- Use BEM naming convention for SCSS classes.nn## 9. Internationalizationn- All user-facing strings must be defined in a single locales file (e.g., `src/locales/en.json`) and accessed via translation keys.nn## 10. Testingn- Write tests for all components and utilities.n- Use descriptive test names.nn## 11. Git & Version Controln- Use meaningful commit messages.n- Keep PRs focused and small.nn## 12. Documentationn- Document complex logic with comments.n- Keep the README up to date.
